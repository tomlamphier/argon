## Knee Techniques
1.  Attempted choke => Drain, 2X strike outside 
of triceps, 2X down hammer fist inside of elbows. 
Double cupped palm strike to ears, eye gouge with 
thumbs, grab back of head & pull down into rising 
front knee. Hop knee off back leg striking the 
face. Grab chin with right hand, left hand behind 
head, push L, then pull out and around. Rake face 
with right fingers, step out with right foot. 
Attacker does back fall, protects face with 
x-block, back rolls away. You aim a stomp kick 
at the attacker's middle.

2.  Straight punch with right, stepping in => step 
straight to the left while fanning away attack 
with left. Plum blossom. Turn toward attacker, step 
 in with left and do knife-hand under ear. Grab 
 shoulder with both hands, pull towards you while 
 doing a L knee strike behind his knee. Shift 
 L leg to front to hyper-extend attacker's knee 
 and push upper body forward. Knee strike with L 
 to face. He should do a side fall. You clear 
 attacker's knees with your foot, stomp kick to 
 groin. Attacker back rolls out.

3.  Attempted choke => usual drain, clear hands, go after 
attacker's R arm: you catch fist with your R, 
slide your L arm under and move in to the side 
with your L foot, wrap your L arm over 
attacker's arm. Lean in slightly to force 
attacker to bend forward, L knee to rotator 
cup or chest, R knee to face, deep back stance 
to drop him. Hold onto R arm, drop knee to ribs, 
then to neck. Attacker does face fall, then 
front fall away. You watch your back and head 
in opposite direction to attacker's roll.

4.  Attempted choke => usual drain, clear hands, grab 
attacker's ghi at lapels with both hands & pull 
strongly to you. Front knee, front round knee, 
hop back knee. Turn towards your back leg so 
that your back is to him as you put that foot 
down. Scoop with L under arm while doing a 
reverse osoto. Attacker does a front fall, 
then thread the needle + front roll away. 
(I do 360 leg swing in place of thread 
the needle.) The finish is to sweep the atacker's arm
from under, stomp kick, watch your back.

5.  Attempted choke => usual drain, clear hands, go to 
outside holding wrist and upper arm of 
attacker's R arm. Force arm down as you come 
up with a L knee strike to do a break. Hop 
knee strike to stomach with R, do a kosoto 
sweep. Attacker does front fall, then 360 
sweep + front roll. The finish is to sweep 
the atacker's arm from under, stomp kick, watch your back.

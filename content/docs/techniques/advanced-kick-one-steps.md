## Advanced Kick One Steps
This series of techniques uses kicks to counter a straight punch.
We do each technique twice: once with the left foot forward, once with the right.

1.  Outside crescent off the front leg, place it down in back, same foot
front kick, place it down in front. Turn kick with back foot,
shuffle back.  Those able to do it: jump front kick, followed by turn kick while still in air.

2.  Outside crescent kick off the front leg, place it down in back, turn kick 
same foot, turn kick off back foot. Those able: jump turn kick and second turn kick 
while in air.

3.  Inside crescent off the back foot, placing it down, side kick,
turning back kick. Those able: don't place foot down after inside crescent,
go straight into side kick.

4.  Inside crescent off the back leg, place it down, turning back kick 2X.

5.  Inside crescent kick off front leg, place it down, turning back hook kick with back leg,
reverse osoto.  Those able: instead of reverse osoto, keep turning so you face back, drop
with palms to the floor, working leg goes straight back, reverse sweep, then come up.

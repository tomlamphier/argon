## Sanuces Techniques

Notes below assume that the attacker has the right foot forward.

1.  **Cross-hand grab.**
  
Close both hands into a fist. Turn held hand up in a half-circle going to the outside of the 
attacking arm.  Step in and do a back fist to the ribs with your free hand. 
Step back diagonally to position your held hand just past the attacker's center.
Trap attacker's hand with nikio 1. Add a front kick off the back leg to help the nikio work, drop 
attacker in front with a pivot so that he (she) is facing sideways. At this point the uke is
face down and you are holding one arm. Finish
 with left stomp below shoulder, turn right and place foot down near neck,
 stomp right, step back, pull arm forward to dislocate shoulder.

2.  **Choke.**
 
Small step back right, double knuckle strike to arms just above elbows.
Double hammer fist down, double clap to ears, eye gouge.  Grab across to attacking hand 
on your left, doing a cross elbow to the side of the face.  Hold with both hands,
twist to the right to bring your left elbow over the lock,
put your weight on your arm to apply a nikio.  Uke is face down and you are holding an arm. Finish
with drop knee to ribs, drop knee to shoulder, front roll in the direction that the uke's head is
facing. 

3.  **Cross-hand grab.**
  
Begin like (1) above, after back fist, do a hammer fist upward to
bicep of attacking arm and secure the elbow in your armpit.  You should have a come-along
lock at this point.  Do a half circle to the right, reverse, grab the elbow with your left and 
and use both hands in a flipping motion to throw the attacker.  Use your leg as a fulcrum to turn the attacker over on
his (her) stomach.  Still holding the arm, knee to ribs, knee to shoulder,
front roll perpendicular over uke.

4.  **Rear naked choke hold from behind.**  

Tilt chin down, move into elbow.  Back elbow on other side to 
midsection, low back fist to groin.  Place your left hand by your ear, bend forward,
slide back and put attacker in a figure 4 lock from behind.  Pivot to drop.  
Roll out forward to dislocate shoulder.

5.  **Rear naked choke hold from behind.**  

Begin like (3).  Push chin up with your left hand, step turn to your right,
Put left arm under attacker's chin to unbalance backward onto your leg.  
Down right elbow to chest, down right knife hand to chest. Repeat with left.
Shift leg to drop attacker.

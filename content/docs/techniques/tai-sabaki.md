# Tai Sabaki
*Tai Sabaki* is a Jujitsu technique that means "body management."
The goal of tai sabaki is to get out of the line of attack using footwork
and optionally counterattack. 
It uses push stepping, which is a way of moving where the back foot
propels you, as opposed to normal steping.  

## Tai Sabaki 1
This is the basic technique.  It moves in the four diagonals (R front, L 
front, R back, L back) and two 90 degree turns (L, R).
You can do tai sabaki 1 with a partner or by yourself.  The attack
is a simple overhead strike repeated siz times.

1. Step R forward diagonal, then back.

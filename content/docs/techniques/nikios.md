## Nikio Techniques

1.  Cross-hand grab.  Spear hand to the eyes, trap attacker's
hand, small circle with other hand to the outside, wrapping around
attacker's hand. Bring up to chest level and point to other's belt.
Sink to force attacker down. Put hand under elbow, push it towards head
to throw forward. Drop knee 2X, kick.

2.  Same-side grab.  Spear hand to eyes, raise held hand so that 
that attacker's wrist is in the gap between your thumb and index finger.
Trap attacker's wrist with free hand. Bring over to center and apply nikio
lock. Finish like (1).

3.  Two-hand grab on your wrist.  Trap attacker's hands. Execute either
(1) or (2).

4.  Two-hand grab with your hands low at your sides.  Shift hands
to one side (a diversion). Shift them to the other side and 
execute (1).

5.  Two hand grab with your hands at shoulder level in front. 
Reach over with either hand to grab the meat of the opposite 
hand. On that side bring your elbow over the top and press down.
Finish as above.

6.  Same side grab on your shoulder.  Trap the attacker's hand
with your hand on that side. Come across with your other hand while doing a cross elbow (
or slap) to grab the trapped hand. Bring your elbow on that side over the top and drop
attacker. Finish as above.

7.  Attempted choke.  Pick a side and execute (6).

8.  Walking towards you and grabbing your wrist with intention
of holding both your wrists behind you.  Go with the movement, but 
circle in front. Trap wrist, apply nikio.

9.  Coming from back and grabbing your wrist. Again, go with the movement, trap,
bring the elbow of your other hand over the top to apply a nikio.

10. Two-hand grab on one wrist in front.  Trap attacker's wrist, slide in, do downward elbow
against solar plexus with your captive arm.  Finish with (1).

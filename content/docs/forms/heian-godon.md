## Special Limited Space Version

When you are doing this form in a small space, the upper body movements
remain the same, but some of the footwork changes.

Steps 1 thru 7 have the same footwork. For 8, you bring your right
foot back so that you can move forward on your left. For 9 you shift left
back to allow right to step forward.

For 10, you bring the right foot back, again to make room
for the left to move.  12 has you bring your left back so
that you can do an inside crescent kick with your right. 

Steps 13 thru 20 have the same footwork as the regular version.

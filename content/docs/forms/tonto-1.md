## Tonto Form 1
This is a Jujitsu knife form with three sections, done on the right side, then
repeated left.  There are 10 strikes.  In the first section, you are 
stationary and each count is a strike.  You move forward with a push step
in the second section, and each count has two strikes. 
Finally, the third section is like the second, but you are moving backward.  

You hold the knife with a hammer grip; your free hand guards your
front with the palm facing you because you don't want to expose 
the inside of your wrist to attack.  When you are doing the right side, 
you have the knife in your right, and your right foot is in front.  Left side is 
the mirror of this.

The strikes are:

1.  Outside down diagonal, shoulder to waist.
2.  Inside down diagonal, as above.
3.  Outside up diagonal, waist to shoulder.
4.  Inside up diagonal.
5.  Turn knife blade horizontal, stab straight to ribs 
    on same side.
6.  Outside cut across belly.
7.  Horizontal stab to ribs on other side.
8.  Inside cut across belly.
9.  Straignt down middle of chest.
10. Upward stab just above belly. KIUP!

Note: *Inside* and *Outside* directions refer to the starting point
of the strike or block, which is the Jujitsu convention.

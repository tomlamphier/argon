## Han Su Form
Han Su is the longest form that I learned in Hapkido.  I'm
breaking it up into 4 sections so that it doesn't 
seem overwhelming.

## Section 1
1.  From a relaxed feet-apart stance, bring R
foot in, arms up in a large circle, palms together
at chest level, bow, tilting head slightly L.

2.  Extend L hand out in front (spear hand with palm up), while sliding
L foot forward into a back stance.  R hand does a high block
with palm out at forehead level.  You are facing 45 degrees to R.

3.  Turn from waist forward into front stance. R arm extends forward into 
palm strike. L arm rotates with body to side.

4.  Turn at waist back to 45 degree R diagonal, arms follow, closing into chest,
into horse stance.

5.  Bring arms out with palms facing away from you.

6.  Plum blossom, moving R first, ending with L knife hand forward.

7.  Turn from waist into front stance, R vertical fist, L hand
supporting upper arm.

8.  R horizontal spear hand, L goes under.

9.  Repeat of (1).

10. Mirror of steps (2) thru (8).  

## Section 2

1.  Turn R, R spear hand to side at neck level, palm up, L foot 
slides in behind R.

2.  R foot steps into horse stance, R palm strike to groin, L hand
supporting elbow.

3.  R foot shifts back to a cat stance, R palm strike under chin. 

4.  R knife hand strike to neck as R foot moves into front stance.

5.  L foot slides up behind, L spear hand palm up to 
neck, R arm comes back to chamber near ear. 

6.  Left foot steps forward into front stance, double low palm strike. 

7.  Turn R 3/4 to face forward, horse stance.  While turning, bring wrists together, rotate together as if turning somebody's head around.
Inside block L, R vertical punch.  

8.  Mirror (1) to (7) on left side.

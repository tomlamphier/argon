## Forms
A martial arts form is a fixed series of steps that
combine movements, blocks, and strikes, and which can be
practices by an individual.  

There are two main branches of forms:

1. Open hand forms , which consist of punches, kicks, etc.
2. Weapons forms, which involve using a weapon, such as a dagger.

## Ten Sho
Ten sho is a breathing form with movements that are 
done in a very small space. Your elbows and upper arms
stay glued to your ribs throughout for protection. Also,
most of the stances are an hourglass where your toes point inward
and your knees touch. This is protective of your groin.

1.  You begin with feet together and hands folded in
front of your groin.  Close hands into fists, pull them
quickly back into chamber while turning your toes outward.
Breathe in as you do this, then exhale and bring fists into a 
low X block. Shift the heels out, toes together, knees together.

2.  Breathe in, double inside block, breathe out.

3.  Breathe in, step forward right into hourglass stance,
right inside block, exhale.

4.  Inhale, circle block with right hand, palm down from
right shoulder. Turn palm up, circle other way, 
pull back into crane hand to the rear. Exhale,
slow knife/palm strike forward to solar plexus.

5.  Breathe in. Turn fingers of right hand up,
pull in. Exhale, slow palm strike to groin.

6.  Breathe in. Rising crane strike with right.
Exhale, knife hand/palm strike to solar plexus. 

7.  Breathe in. Right palm strike to left side,
right crane to right again. Exhale, right palm 
to floating ribs. 

8.  Repeat 3-7 on left side.

9.  Repeat 3-7 doing both sides at once.

10. Exhale. Sharp double crane strike, extending
arms straight out from shoulders.  Inhale. Double 
horizontal block with palms down, pulling in your 
elbows immediately. Bring palms in towards your chest.
Exhale. Move hands straight down, forming a triangle.
Repeat 10 a total of three times.

11.

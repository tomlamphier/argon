## Rope Stick

Loop cord over your right wrist and flip the stick up
to catch and hold it.  This is the "held" position.  If you let go
the stick drops to a free swinging position.  
 
Ready position is arms folded, rope stick in right hand 
(held position), tucked under left arm.

1.  Step forward with right foot, strike down, 
then to outside, then pull back and do straight strike to
chest level.

2.  Bring left foot up behind right knee so that you 
are standing on your right foot. Strike forward with
left high block.

3.  Place left foot down in front, low downward strike,
right front kick, right over left hand bringing back foot up
behind, ending with mid-level down strike.

4.  Step forward left, left high block, right curving strike across
at temple.

5.  Curving temple strike to right, then left, pull back,
right knee comes up, then place it in front as you do 
straight strike to midsection. 

6.  Twist to left as you do a low downward strike on the 
right, untwist moving left arm to protect your front and
right pointing stick to the throat.  Note: the arms form an
X, crossing at the elbow.  

7.  Extend left arm straight with a fist, position stick
high behind your ear, bring left foot in behind right.

8.  Free stick, swing it around to your left side so that
it temporarily wraps around your midsection, reverse direction
turning whole body to the right, completing turn by
catching the stick and striking midlevel straight back. (John Rome recommends
catching end of stick with your free hand as you turn for balance.)
Note: Your feet are together, right in front. Also, you have made a half turn, so you
are facing what was your back.

9.  Right back kick, replace it, downward strike.

10. Drop stick, swing overhead clockwise one full turn, turning your body so that you
face the original front direction. Catch the stick, left high block, straight 
strike to midsection.

11. Left arm comes across, back foot comes up, low 
right strike, swing over top to down strike, rotate arms over,
down strike. Reach out with left to grab, circular down
strike to collarbone. 

12. 1/2 turn to right, left high block, right downwrd strike with 
back end of stick.

## Joong Bong 
Joong Bong is a short stick weapons form.  You do the form three times: once in place, once going forward,
and once going backward.  When you are going forward or backward, each
count has two moves.

The forward stepping is:
  - move forward foot
  - bring back in to shoulder distance
  - repeat 

Backward stepping is simply the reverse.

The ready sequence starts with the joong bong
in your right hand, concealed behind your arm.  Bow. Bring the weapon out in front,
hold with both hands at head level as right foot steps forward.

Note: The following steps are for the right side.  You mirror them
for the left side.

1. Hold stick vertical momentarily, then inside level swing aimed at left temple, ending behind your left shoulder
   and slightly lower.  Target is the temple.

2. Repeat 1. Target is the jaw.

3. Outside level swing to right temple, ending on 
   your right. Target is the temple.
   
4. Repeat 3. At end tip of stick points forward. Target is 
   the jaw.

5. Circle stick leading into a downward to upward strike
   to the knees or ribs. Swing ends just below your left
   shoulder.
   
6. Downward to upward swing targeting ribs or knees. Ends
   with stick at shoulder level.

7. Inside swing level to the ribs.
 
8. Circling downward strike on your left in front (collar bone on your left).

9. Repeat 8. targeting other collarbone.

10. Horizontal swing to the ribs, end with stick on the right
    at shoulder level.

11. Downward to upward diagonal strike on the right, ending with 
    stick at shoulder level, left.
    
12. Downward to upward strike on the left, ending with stick
    slightly behind right shoulder. KIUP    

Ending is reverse of ready sequence: joong bong in both hands, then parked, then bow.

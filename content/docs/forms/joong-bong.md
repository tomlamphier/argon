## Joong Bong 
Joong Bong is a short stick weapons form.  Each count has two 
moves.  You do the form three times: once in place, once going forward,
and once going backward.  When you are going forward, step forward right as you
 do the first move, then bring left together, then move right forward as you do the second part. 
 Going backward, it's the reverse footwork. The ready sequence starts with the joong bong
in your right hand, concealed behind your arm.  Bow. Bring the weapon out in front,
hold with both hands at head level as right foot steps forward.

1. Inside level swing aimed at left temple, done twice. At end of 
second swing, joong bong is past your left shoulder, just below it.

2. Outside level swing to right temple, done twice. At end of second swing, right hand is
at your right ear and bottom of stick is pointing forward.

3. Diagonal down strike to left side at knee level, arcing up. 
Diagonal down strike to right knee, arcing up. At end of second strike,
your right is again at your ear like (2), bottom pointing forward. 

4. Inside swing level to the ribs, then a downward strike on your left in front (collar bone).

5. Second downward strike in front, then diagonal downward strike 
across ending at your right side, the bottom of the stick low.

6. Upward diagonal to your left, reverse along same diagonal. *Kiup*.

Ending is reverse of ready sequence: joong bong in both hands, then parked, then bow.

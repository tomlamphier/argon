## Cane Technique

The attack for each of the techniques below is a front kick 
followed by a shoulder-level straight punch. The first part 
of the defense is to slide back slightly to get out of range 
from the kick. You reach out and touch to attacker's toes
(for judging distance). Next, you apply a counter.

All end with a down strike and kiup.

1. Move diagonally out of the line of attack forward right into 
a front stance while striking the ribs with the tip of the cane.
Next a straight poke to the solar plexus as you go into a cat stance,
finally a turning back kick with the right foot.  Attacker
does a back fall. You whip the cane horizontally.

2. Begin like (1), but instead of back kick, hook the attacker's
neck with the cane and pull down.  Attacker does a front fall.

3. Use cane to block the punch on the outside, poke shoulder
to unbalance. bring cane around and hook lead foot.     

4. Same as (3), but instead of hooking leg, step past and 
hook neck.

5. Inside block into circular movement, step in left, right
behind, then left behind attacker's lead leg. Meanwhile continue
the circle over the attacker's shoulder and point the cane down.

6. Outside block steping in with your left, cross right 
foot in front while turning to your right. Keep turning so
that you place your left foot in front of the attacker's lead
and your back
faces attacker. Hook cane under arm and do reverse o soto.

7. Swing cane horizontally to strike ribs. Grab the punching hand
and use the cane to lever the attacker to fall towards
his (her) rear.

8. Same as (7), but bring attacker around to your rear like
tai otoshi. 

9. Again like (7), but bring your left hand in to grab the 
wrist, turn under and throw.

10. Don't reach out for the kick; slash at it with the cane. Full turn to your right,
bringing the cane across the attacker's face.

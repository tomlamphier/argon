## Techniques
Techniques are a type of training where you learn how to
defend yourself in different situations.  A technique has two roles:

1.  Attacker, or uke
2.  Defender, or tori

When two students practice a technique, they usually 
switch roles from time to time so that they experience 
both sides.  The attacker starts off with a specific
attack, for example an attempted choke.  The defender
responds by avoiding, neutralizing, or countering the
attack.  

Techniques are usually grouped in sets by the kind of attack
or the defensive move.

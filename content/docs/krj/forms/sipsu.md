## Sip Soo
Imagine a straight line pointing directly ahead. You 
travel along this line as you go forward and back. The 
ready stance is feet together, hands in a "sun and moon"
clasp at chest level, left enclosing right. 

(1)  Stretch left arm up, right down at your side
and rise slightly as you bring your left foot back
to a front stance.  Hands are open.  Slowly bring left hand 
down and right up until right is mid-chest and left 
is low. 

(2)  Turn to left diagonal and repeat (1) on other
side.

(3)  Drop left arm horizontally and look right.  
Right ridge hand to the side into a back stance. (Note: for this moment
you are facing 90 degrees from your straight line.)

(4)  Right leg comes in with left down block. Step forward 
right, right palm to ribs in a back stance.  Repeat 
2X.

(5)  1/4 turn left, right foot crosses over left
as you do a high X block with left in front. Step out
left and do double down block.

(6)  Skip left, bringing up so that upper arms
are horizontal, forearms vertical, and fists are
straight up. (call this arms-up for short.) 
Kiup!

Note: Be sure to stretch arms back so they are 
in line with your body--not bending slightly forward.

(7)  Turn 1/4 right, bringing right arm up to high
block, left to chamber.  Left inside crescent kick,
turning 1/4 right, landing in horse stance. Left punch to the side at shoulder 
level, bring arms down and circle to arms-up. Repeat to the left, then once more to the
right.

(8)  Arms-up, Right foot comes in to shoulder width.
Turn 1/4 to right with right knife hand.

(9)  Double hand push in front. Right forearm
straight up in front, left hand under as you bring 
left foot behind knee. Shift hands so that left palm
faces right palm at your side. Step forward left,
switching right above left, palms forward, hands 
about 3 inches apart.  

Circle right arm in front to repeat above on left
side. 

(10)  Chamber both hands open to right. Turn 3/4
to left into grab-pull (the move at the end of 
Jujitsu form 1). 

(11)  Look over right shoulder, step out right, 
do grab-pull. 

(12)  1/4 turn left, right arm circles into outside
block, left to chamber, left foot in cat stance.
Step forward left with high block left. Step forward right
with right punch. 

(13)  Back foot comes in as you do 1/2 turn to the left.
Hands return to initial sun and moon position. 
Finally bring fists down in front.

## Palm Techniques

1.  Attack is a straight punch (assume right) to the head.  
    Soft block to the left, move in with left palm to 
    face, pivot right with left palm to groin. Reverse o soto.

2.  Choke.
    Chin down, double knuckle above elbows, clear up
    the middle. Right palm to face, left to ribs, right
    to groin. Moving slightly to your left, grab back
    of head with both hands, pull down to rising knee
    strike. Ko soto.

3.  Choke.
    Begin like (2), double palm to ears, left palm to 
    face, right to face, right downward back fist to 
    chest + uppercut. Spinning o soto.

    Finish: Kick under ribs with right foot, step
    on back, drop knee left, drop knee right, roll out.

4.  Cross hand wrist grab (assume your right is held).
    Small inside circle with right ending with wrist
    grab, lifting arm and an upward palm strike with
    left (hyper extension). Left palm to groin, then
    bicep to fold arm back. Koto oroshi.

    Finish: Roll attacker over on stomach, double drop knee,
    roll out forward. 

5.  Double wrist grab.
    Quick release 8 (double hand circle over top).
    Keep hold on left side, right palm to face, 
    raise arm, right up elbow to allow you to 
    duck under. Hold wrist with both hands and keep 
    turning until you have paul lock. Switch lock by
    folding down, switch again into arm bar + takedown.

    Finish: Double drop knee, roll out across.

6.  Push both shoulders from behind.
    Step forward left and use left hand to trap 
    the hand on your right shoulder. Turn right and
    do right palm strike to ribs. Raise right arm and
    bring your left foot back so that you have attacker
    snug against your right shoulder. Turn body left
    to throw. 

    Finish: Roll attacker over to stomach, do a figure 4
    arm lock, roll out forward.

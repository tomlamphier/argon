## Nikios
The nikios are a technique with a special wrist lock.  Generally the way
it is done is that your free hand may make a quick strike to distract,
then grab the attacker's hand on top with your thumb between attacker's
thumb and index fingers and your other fingers gripping the other side.
You make a small circke with the captive hand to come on top, then grab
the wrist.  Get attacker's arm in a "Z" bend and center the lock on his/her
middle.  Turn in and down to your belt as if you are driving a 
scooter. 

Attacker must drop to kneeling position, at which point you slide in,
hook your free hand thumb just above the elbow, pivot, do arm bar, to
lay attacker out in front.  Finish with 2 knee strikes, checking front
and back directions.  

1. X-hand wrist grab -> spear hand to eyes, complete above nikio lock & finish.

2. Same side wrist grab -> swing held arm in then out with free hand
doing a palm strike to the face. Turn held palm to face you, bring it
across to your free hand.  Free hand + held hand set up nikio,
complete lock & finish.

3. 2-hand wrist grab on one -> choose (1) or (2) above, execute.

4. 2-hand wrist grab on either side low.  Fake swing to one side, swing
the other way, complete like (2).

5. 2-hand wrist grab, your hands up in front -> reach over with one hand
to grab the attacker's hand, twist your body to bring near elbow over the top
to get a nikio lock.  Complete the usual way.

6. Shoulder push -> step back on the pushed side to drain the energy of the
attack, opposite side slap to the face, continuing to grab, twist body
to bring near elbow over top.  Complete the usual way.

7. 2-hand grab of your lapels -> just like (6), but distraction strike
is a cross elbow followed by trapping one of the arms. The other elbow also does a cross strike when you
bring it over the top. 

8. Walking grab coming towards you with attempt to continue around and 
grab your other hand -> turn and follow, trap with your free hand, get 
in close enough & complete the usual way.

9. Walking grab from behnd attempting to pull you along -> take a few steps
forward to get in front of attacker, turn & trap with free hand to initiate
lock, bring close elbow over the top, finish like (5) or (7).

10. 2-hand wrist grab on one -> trap with free hand, step in and do
sinking elbow strike to the solar plexus, step back and complete 
like (3).

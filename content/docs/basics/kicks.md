## Kicks
Most kicks can be done off the lead leg or back leg. Always chamber the 
active leg before and after strike. Curl toes back snugly to avoid injury. 
Hands are up in a fighting position--do not drop them during kick. Judge your
reach to squarely hit the target. Always look at your target.

| Kick | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| front snap | Leg extends straight out in front. Strike with ball of foot. |
| turn or roundhouse | Turn slightly outward on your standing foot as you chamber. Extend strike across horizontally. Striking surface is instep. |
| front side kick | As you chamber turn 180 degrees outward so that your butt is facing the target. Strike using bottom of foot. |
| step behind side kick | Turn inward as back foot crosses behind. Lift and chamber front leg, strike with bottom of foot. |
| side | Turn slightly outward as you chamber, extend to kick with the bottom of foot. |
| back | Step back with lead leg, strike with heel. |
| inside crescent | This kick is done witha wide circular movement from outside to inside about head level. Chamber to the outside, then turn inward with your whole body to execute strike. Striking surface is inside edge of foot. |
| outside crescent | Similar to the inside crescent, but chamber outside and come across outside to inside. Striking surface is outside edge of foot. |
| turning back | This kick is done with one smooth turning movement. Turn inward 180Â° into hourglass stance, chamber back leg and kick with heel. Put foot down as you return to your original position. |
| stomp | Downward strike, sinking slightly. Striking surface is bottom of foot. |
| low side | Extend kick low and use blade of foot as striking surface. |
| low back | Extend low and behind, using heel to strike. |
| shin | Low kick to the shin using inside edge of foot. |

Many of the above kicks can be done as jumps. You begin by jumping 
from the leg that will be active to the standing leg and use the momentum
you gain to drive the rest of the kick.

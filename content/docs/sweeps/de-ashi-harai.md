## De Ashi Harai
This sweep starts from a clinch hold. Each person is grabbing
the other's collar with the right hand and the opposite side sleeve with the left.

1. You step back with your left. The Uke will step forward right to compensate.

2. Before the uke has time to put weight on their forward foot,
pivot on your right foot to face your right while pulling
the uke forward right. Twist the ukeso that his back is now facing you.

3. Sweep across with the bottom of your arch.

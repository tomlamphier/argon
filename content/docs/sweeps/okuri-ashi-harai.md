## Okuri Ashi Harai

This sweep starts like De Ashi Haria from a clinch hold. 

1.  Uke moves his right foot to the side in preparation 
for some move against you. 

2.  Before he has time to put weight on this foot, pull his 
right arm down and push the shoulder from the other side to 
unbalance him to the right. 

3. Sweep across with your left with the bottom of your arch
just above the ankle.

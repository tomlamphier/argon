## Arnis Strikes
These drills are done with a short stick. You start 
with the stick in your right hand, right foot forward. 
At first you do everything stationary, then with V-stepping
(right, then left).  

Repeat on the left side.

Note: When you do a strike, always follow through and bring
the stick back into position behind your shoulder. When you are doing
the V-stepping, the completion of the backward step is done as you
return the stick from the strike.

1.  High strike to person's left temple.
2.  High strike to right temple.

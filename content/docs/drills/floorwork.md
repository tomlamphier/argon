## Floorwork
Basic floorwork is a series of drills that follow a format of 
block + moving forward (or backward) + reverse punch.  The 
side that does the punch is always the next to block.

There are five blocks:

|Block        |Japanese           |Stance       |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
|Rising      |jodan uke           |front        |
|Inside      |chudan uke          |back         |
|Outside     |chudan soto uke     |back         |
|Downward    |geidan bariai       |back         |
|Knife hand  |shuto               |cat          |

The stance is the one you move into while executing the block.  For
example, you step forward (or backward) into a front stance
when doing the rising block.  

The ready sequence is:

1. Right arm out straight with fist.
2. Left fist over arm.
3. Right foot back.
4. Down block.
5. Right reverse punch. KIUP!

#### The Series
Each move is repeated several times going forward, then 
an equal number of times going back.  Both hands are 
involved in the block: one leads, the other completes it.
For the rising block the lead is an upward punch; for inside and outside, 
a straight punch; down, a downward punch; and knife hand, a spear
hand under. 

1. Rising block + reverse punch.
   
2. Step forward with inside block, then reverse punch. Repeat.
   Go backward with same combination to starting point.
   Note: The hand that is not blocking leads the block
   with a straight fist, blocking hand under. Leading hand
   goes to chamber.
   
3. Step forward with outside block, then reverse punch. Repeat.
   Reverse direction as above.
   Note: The hand that is not blocking leads with a 
   straight fist, then goes to chamber. 

4. Step forward with down block, then reverse punch. Repeat.
   Reverse as above.  Hand that does not block leads
   with a down fist, then goes to chamber.
   
5. Step forward into cat stance, leading hand a horizontal
   spear, blocking hand above going to knife hand block. Bring
   your front foot from cat into a front stance.
   Going backward, first take a step back, then do the block 
   and reverse punch. 

#### With Kicks
A kick can be added after the block and before the reverse punch.  
The five kicks that correspond to the series are:

|No.  |Kick          |Japanese         |
|-----|--------------|-----------------|
|1.   | front        |mae geri keage   |
|2.   | turn         |mawashi geri     |
|3.   | side         |yoko geri kekomi |
|4.   | back         |ushiro geeri kekomi|
|5.   | inside hook  |kage geri        |

#### Turns
An alternate way to change direction is to turn 180.
This is done by moving the back foot, turning the body
towards the last punch, leading with the other hand,
and finally executing a block.

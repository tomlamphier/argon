## Short Stick
Today Professor was showing me how to use a drainpipe
in the basement as a target.  There are three paint blotches
on it that correspond to head, ribs, knees.  I can stand in front
of the pipe and use them as targets.  Because space is limited and 
the ceiling is low, I have to use more control to 
make the strikes, and that forces me to clean up my form.

Professor showed me that you keep the level strikes, 
especially to the head parallel to the ground and close
in.  There's a way to turn your wrist when you are pulling back the
stick that brings it back very smoothly and rapidly.
Gotta practice it.  

On a different subject, she says I ought to practice
my punches on my bag.  Kicks not so much, as my feet 
can't take so much steady impact.  She says I ought
to concentrate on kicks I can do, like shin kicks.
